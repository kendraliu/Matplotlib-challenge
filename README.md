This code analyzes the performance of the drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens in the recent animal study on squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

Some findings from this analysis:
1. Capomulin yields significantly smaller tumor at the end of the treatment compared to Infubinol and Ceftamin. Another contestent which yields similar results is Ramicane.
2. A significant decline in the tumor size over time can be seen from a randomly sampled subject that underwent the treatment with Capomulin.
3. The weight of the subjects have a strong correlation with the average tumor size over the course of the treatment with Capomulin (r-value=0.84).
